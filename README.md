# Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) System

Welcome to the Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) System project! This project focuses on building a system for retrieving images based on their visual content rather than relying on metadata or textual information.

## Overview
Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a technique used to search for images in large databases based on their visual content, such as colors, textures, shapes, or any other visual features. This project aims to develop a CBIR system that allows users to search for similar images based on a query image.

## Features
- Implementation of feature extraction techniques to extract visual features from images.
- Construction of an index structure to efficiently store and retrieve feature vectors.
- Integration of similarity metrics to compare feature vectors and rank images based on similarity.
- Development of a user-friendly interface for querying and retrieving images.
- Evaluation of system performance using standard evaluation metrics.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Prepare your dataset: Organize your image dataset and ensure it's properly labeled.
3. Extract visual features: Use feature extraction techniques to extract relevant visual features from images.
4. Build the index structure: Construct an index structure to efficiently store and retrieve feature vectors.
5. Implement querying mechanism: Develop a mechanism to query the system using a query image.
6. Evaluate system performance: Evaluate the performance of the CBIR system using appropriate evaluation metrics.

## Usage
- Use the CBIR system to search for similar images based on a query image.
- Explore retrieved images and analyze the effectiveness of the retrieval system.
- Fine-tune parameters and experiment with different feature extraction techniques to improve retrieval accuracy.
